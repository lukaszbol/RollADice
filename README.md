## 1. Project Description  
Date of the project: 03/2018
This is a simple game created using JavaScript, with an utilisation of HTML and CSS.

GAME RULES:
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
- At the start of the game, the player sets the winnning score (e.g. 20).
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they wish. Each result gets added to his ROUND (Current) score.
- If the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it is the next player's turn.
- A player looses his entire score when he rolls two 6 in a row. After that, the next player continues.
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it is the next player's turn.
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game.
