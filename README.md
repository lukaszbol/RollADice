## 1. Project Description  
<b>Date of the project: 03/2018   </b>

This is a simple game created using JavaScript, with an utilisation of HTML and CSS.

GAME RULES:
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
- At the start of the game, the player sets how many dices they want to use (1 or 2).
- Then, the player sets FINAL SCORE (e.g. 20 points), in the upper-right corner.
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they wish. Each result gets added to their ROUND (Current) score.
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that their ROUND score gets added to the player's GLOBAL score. After that, it is the next player's turn.
- The first player to reach the winning score (e.g. 20 points) on GLOBAL score wins the game.

1 DICE game specific game rules:
- If the player rolls a 1, all their ROUND score gets lost. After that, it is the next player's turn.
- A player looses his entire score when he rolls two 6 in a row. After that, the next player continues.

2 DICES game specific game rules:
- If the player rolls a 1 on one of the dices, all their ROUND score gets lost. After that, it is the next player's turn.
